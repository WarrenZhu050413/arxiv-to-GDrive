            <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
            <p>
                Machine learning systems are increasingly deployed in critical applications, yet their development often lacks the rigorous engineering processes common in traditional software. In this paper, we present a comprehensive framework for the machine learning lifecycle, encompassing data management, model development, deployment, monitoring, and governance. We identify key challenges at each stage and propose structured approaches to address them, drawing from established software engineering practices while accounting for the unique characteristics of machine learning systems. Our framework emphasizes the importance of documentation, testing, validation, and continuous evaluation throughout the lifecycle. Case studies from healthcare, finance, and autonomous systems demonstrate how the framework can be applied to improve reliability, maintainability, and accountability. This work contributes to the emerging field of MLOps by providing a systematic methodology for building machine learning systems that meet the standards required for production environments.
